# Work in Progress


By default, `rdflib` stores triples in memory, which can be read in from and written out to files on disk using a variety of serializations (`rdfxml`, `json-ld`, `ntriples`, `nquads` or `turtle`).  This is analgous to reading in a `data.frame` object from a `csv`, `tsv`, or other text-delimited file, which requires the full data object to be read into memory before a user can manipulate it.  This approach runs into limitations with very large datasets, which may exceed the memory available.  Just as R packages such as `dplyr` offer the ability to perform manipulations with very large data through a connection to a database backend such as SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL, `rdflib` can rely on these and other databases to provide a disk-based backend. 

Unfortunately, at this time, support for these storage devices is not included in the prebuild Mac and Windows binaries of the `redland` R package.  Users wanting to take advantage of disk-based storage must instead build and install the `redland` R package from source; and in some cases, also build the `redland` C libraries from source.  This package provides a [Dockerfile]() containing a portable recipe for building the library with support for the 5 main backend storage devices: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Virtuoso, and Berkeley DB.  This vignette documents the installation and use of these devices.  

## Checking for supported storage devices



## Berkeley DB

The [Berkeley Database]() is a simple key-value store 

> It is the most mature and primary persistent store and suitable for large models, tested in the 2-3 million range.



The [official documentation](http://librdf.org/docs/api/redland-storage-modules.html) for the redland C library describes all supported storage devices.  

## Berkeley Database support

## Testing

`rdflib` uses Circle-CI to test database backends using `docker-compose`.  `docker-compose` pulls down dedicated docker containers for `postgres` and `mariadb`, and a fully-featured R



The badge below (also on the package README) indicates that these dedicated tests are passing.
