Dear CRAN maintainers,

I am pleased to propose rdflib for an initial release to CRAN.  
This fixes the previous problem in resolving a URL in the CITATION file.

## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
